<br>
He introduced himself as Tobi but later on after the death of the Akatsuki leader Nagato or Pain, Who was'nt killed but was defeated by Naruto Uzumaki due to which he used his Rinne Rebirth to bring back the lives of many dead shinobis' in which there was Kakashi.The man named Tobi told that he was Madara Uchiha.
